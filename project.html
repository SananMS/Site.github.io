            <p class="aboutHour">At the Hour of Code, our team did a good job. Firstly, the main part of excellent performance is preparation. We had a big discussion, where we talked about our future class
                and planned each detail of it. Then, we have found a regional school; have established a warm relationship with students. We had a lot of work - recording the session, editing its video,
                taking photos, sending kids their certificates of successful work, regarding solved problems, and answering pupils’ questions. As a team, we decided to find a solution to the problems
                by asking for ideas from various school members. It made class time more interesting. In summary, the lesson was conducted with great success, excited kids solved puzzles, 
                and whenever they had mistakes or questions we gave detailed answers. In the end, we took some pictures with them.</p>

                This project was interesting to us. We learned one new programming language and two new markup languages and then we created our own page. 
                The first thing we did was learn these languages from codecademy.com. Afterward, we discussed what kind of website we will create.
                As a team, we decided and planned our webpage’s style and concepts. We divided things between team members. Each member did his/her job. 
                If we had difficulties, we would help each other and would solve that problem. When everyone completed their job, we made a meeting and discussed it again.
                In the meeting, we included some extra ideas, gathered all the results, and made a whole webpage out of it. Finally, we created our webpage successfully.

                What is Robotics?
            </h2>

                As technology progresses, so too does the scope of what is considered robotics.
                Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions.
                In 2005, 90% of all robots could be found assembling cars in automotive factories.
                These robots consist mainly of mechanical arms tasked with welding or screwing on certain parts of a car.
                Today, we’re seeing an evolved and expanded definition of robotics that includes the development, creation and use of bots that explore Earth’s harshest conditions, robots that assist law-enforcement and even robots that assist in almost every facet of healthcare.

                We held a meeting and talked about our project. Firstly, we all downloaded software(EV3), and read the instruction.
                It was the first time that we needed to combine some blocks for the robot's movement. Yes, we had some challenges.
                Therefore, we searched and looked at some videos for better understanding. Then, we tried to apply what we have learned.
                It is difficult without a robot because we do not know will our codes help to activate it or not. Despite all difficulties, we are trying to do our best.
